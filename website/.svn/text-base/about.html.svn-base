        About Us:
      </h1>
      <p>
        X-Wrt was started because there was a need for end user extensions to OpenWrt, such as an enhanced web management console (webif).
        For a long time now it has been established that OpenWrt is the best firmware in its class. It far exceeds other firmwares in
        performance, stability, extensibility, robustness, and design. We at X-Wrt decided it was long past time for end users to get
        access to this superior firmware.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a separate project from OpenWrt due to the difference in focus and development ideals. We are considerably more pragmatic
        than OpenWrt and have the goal of providing solutions today, while OpenWrt has a more idealistic development philosophy and intends
        to perfect the firmware core, no matter how many rewrites and how much time it takes. This difference in development attitude
        creates a complimentary atmosphere that benefits everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a free, open-source, community-driven project. Our primary project ideals are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Free and open-source.</strong> The project should be entirely free and open-source, licensed under the GPL. The project
          should always be hosted at an easily accessible site and source code readily available and easily built.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Easy entrance.</strong> The project should always be open to new contributors and have a low entrance barrier. Anyone
          should be able to contribute. We actively grant write access to anyone interested in having it. We believe people are responsible
          when given responsibility. Just ask and we'll sign you up.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community driven.</strong> This isn't about 'us' offering 'you' something, it's about everyone coming together to work
          towards the common goal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No monetary donations without accounting.</strong> The project can not accept monetary donations without having a
          treasurer to hold and account for all donations and what they have went towards.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project is still young, but we are accomplishing things at a rapid pace. All our work is currently in beta, but our code can
        be used today and is more stable than many firmwares in their 'final' state. You can keep up with the latest developments by
        checking the xwrt-svncheckins message list that archives commit logs as they happen: <a href=
        "http://groups.google.com/group/x-wrt-commits">http://groups.google.com/group/x-wrt-commits</a>.
