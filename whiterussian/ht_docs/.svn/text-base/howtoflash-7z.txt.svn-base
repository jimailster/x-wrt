About 7z Files
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To save disk space and bandwidth costs we distribute X-Wrt firmware 
images in the form of 7-Zip archives. 7-Zip is an archiver like 
PKZIP, TAR/GZIP, RAR, etc. Most common archiving software can 
extract 7-Zip archives. RAR can for instance extract them. The official
software is at http://www.7-zip.org and is free and open-source for
Windows, Linux, and other platforms.

Each 7-Zip archive contains *ALL* firmware images even though the
compressed size is smaller than any one image uncompressed. That is
why we save so much space.

Once you have extracted the 7-Zip archive, simply flash the image to
your router using standard methods (web UI, TFTP, etc..).
