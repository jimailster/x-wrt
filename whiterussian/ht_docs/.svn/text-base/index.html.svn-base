        <strong>X-Wrt</strong> is a set of packages and patches to enhance the end user experience of OpenWrt. It is NOT a fork of OpenWrt.
        We work in conjunction with the OpenWrt developers to extend OpenWrt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our packages currently work with the latest public release of OpenWrt -
		Kamikaze 7.09. Support of OpenWrt's upcoming Kamikaze firmware is coming soon.
		We currently have a stable webif for OpenWrt White Russian. Explore this page to learn about
        our work, or just skip straight to installing X-Wrt and see the fruits of our labor yourself.

        Introduction to X-Wrt
      </h2>
      <p>
        X-Wrt was started because there was a need for end user extensions to OpenWrt, such as an enhanced web management console (webif).
        For a long time now it has been established that OpenWrt is the best firmware in its class. It far exceeds other firmwares in
        performance, stability, extensibility, robustness, and design. We at X-Wrt decided it was long past time for end users to get
        access to this superior firmware.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a separate project from OpenWrt due to the difference in focus and development ideals. We are considerably more pragmatic
        than OpenWrt and have the goal of providing solutions today, while OpenWrt has a more idealistic development philosophy and intends
        to perfect the firmware core, no matter how many rewrites and how much time it takes. This difference in development attitude
        creates a complimentary atmosphere that benefits everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a free, open-source, community-driven project. Our primary project ideals are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Free and open-source.</strong> The project should be entirely free and open-source, licensed under the GPL. The project
          should always be hosted at an easily accessible site and source code readily available and easily built.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Easy entrance.</strong> The project should always be open to new contributors and have a low entrance barrier. Anyone
          should be able to contribute. We actively grant write access to anyone interested in having it. We believe people are responsible
          when given responsibility. Just ask and we'll sign you up.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community driven.</strong> This isn't about 'us' offering 'you' something, it's about everyone coming together to work
          towards the common goal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No monetary donations without accounting.</strong> The project can not accept monetary donations without having a
          treasurer to hold and account for all donations and what they have went towards.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project is still young, but we are accomplishing things at a rapid pace. All our work is currently in beta, but our code can
        be used today and is more stable than many firmwares in their 'final' state. You can keep up with the latest developments by
        checking the xwrt-svncheckins message list that archives commit logs as they happen: <a href=
        "https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/xwrt-svncheckins">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/xwrt-svncheckins</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our latest stable snapshot of webif&sup2; is <strong>Milestone 3 RC2</strong>. The install buttons below will have you install it. If
        you then use the webif's update feature you will get the latest internal build.

        Installation Instructions
      </h2>
      <p>
        X-Wrt is a set of packages that overlay OpenWrt. There are two primary ways to install and use X-Wrt on your router:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flash a pre-built image of OpenWrt White Russian with X-Wrt packages like webif&sup2; already included.
        </li>
        <li>Flash OpenWrt White Russian stock image, then install webif&sup2; and any other X-Wrt packages.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        Method #1:
      </h3><em>Flash pre-built OpenWrt White Russian images</em>
      <ul>
        <li>Browse the X-Wrt ftp directory for the OpenWrt/X-Wrt firmware image appropriate for your router (based on the filename).
        </li>
        <li>Flash the image to your router by using either your existing firmware's web interface to upgrade the firmware or alternate
        methods. If you have questions, advanced instructions are available on OpenWrt's Wiki.
          <br />

        Method #2
      </h3><em>Flash OpenWrt White Russian then install X-Wrt packages</em>
      <p>
        If you do not already have OpenWrt White Russian on your router, download an appropriate OpenWrt White Russian image and flash it
        (follow instructions in OpenWrt's wiki). We recommend White Russian RC5, RC6, or 0.9. Kamikaze support is a work in progress, but
        many functions are supported already. 
      </p><em class="warning">WARNING: Do not install webif&sup2; on the micro images OpenWrt distributes. They lack the 'ipkg' package,
      which is currently critical to the proper operation of webif&sup2;</em>
      <h4>
        Installation:
      </h4>
      <ol>
        <li>SSH to your router, or telnet if you've not set a password yet.
        <li>Add the X-Wrt package repository with this command:<br />
          <code>echo "src X-Wrt http://download2.berlios.de/pub/xwrt/packages" >> /etc/ipkg.conf</code></li>
        <li>Refresh the package lists this command:<br />
          <code>ipkg update</code></li>
        <li>Finally, install webif^2 via:<br />
          <code>ipkg install http://ftp.berlios.de/pub/xwrt/webif_latest_stable.ipk</code></li>
        </ol>
          <br />
          <em class="warning">Be warned, the very first install of webif&sup2; may reboot your router! Subsequent updates to webif^2 (probably) won't.</em>

        Webif&sup2; Problems
      </h2>
      <p>
        Since our new webif is in beta sometimes you can get a build that has problems. The best advice is:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Upgrade to a newer build when it is available.
        </li>
        <li>Report bugs or other errata you see if you don't find it fixed in the next build. It's hard for us to test every build
        thoroughly.
        </li>
        <li>If you somehow got unlucky and ended up with a daily build that was horribly broken and you can't upgrade the webif, ssh into
        the router and run this:
          <br />
          <code>ipkg install http://ftp.berlios.de/pub/xwrt/webif_latest.ipk -force-reinstall</code>
        </li>

        X-Wrt Packages
      </h2>
      <p>
        Although all our work is based around our webif&sup2; package, we actually have a number of packages to add to OpenWrt. At present
        they are all for White Russian, but we are moving actively into Kamikaze right now. A list of some of our packages are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>webif&sup2;</strong> - our new webif, but you already know that ;).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>miniupnpd</strong> - an offering of this excellent new upnp daemon.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>tarfs</strong> - a specialized pseudo-filesystem for micro sized routers. - alpha stage development
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>busybox 1.4.1</strong> - an update over the Busybox 1.0 used in White Russian. It also includes some different applets,
          like user management utilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>wireless-tools v29 pre10</strong> - an update to wireless-tools (iwconfig, iwlist, etc..).
        </li>
        <li>

        OpenWrt Kamikaze Plans
      </h2>
      <p>
        We are working actively towards a version of the webif for OpenWrt's
		long delayed next generation, Kamikaze. The webif is not finished yet
		you get its status at <a href="http://wiki.x-wrt.org/index.php/Kamikaze">
		http://wiki.x-wrt.org/index.php/Kamikaze</a>.</p>
      <p>
        OpenWrt Kamikaze represents a substantial and fundamental change. It is not simply a new version of White Russian, but instead a
        complete rewrite of the build root and configuration structure. That is why White Russian went stagnant for so long, the developers
        quit working on it in favor of this more ambitious idealized solution. This new branch of OpenWrt took a long, long time to hash
        out, but now its almost ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ever-popular NVRAM configuration storage system is no longer utilized in Kamikaze. It has been replaced with configuration
        files, many stored in the common format known as 'UCI'. This was done because although an emulated NVRAM storage area to keep tuple
        based configuration data can be easily implemented on any platform, the OpenWrt developers felt it wasn't structured enough for
        their tastes. So, out the window it went.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make the webif work with Kamikaze we therefore have to work with this new configuration system. The good news is our webif
        already supports UCI. Some pages, like the QoS page, use the UCI system entirely.

        Can I use X-Wrt in my commercial venture?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Yes, you can use X-Wrt in whatever way you like, providing you do not violate the terms of the GPL license agreement. We can even
        help you to rebrand the webif and tweak it to suit your needs. <a href="mailto:xwrt-private-dev@lists.berlios.de">Email
        us</a> to inquire about webif related contract work.

        other developers on the irc channel (#x-wrt / freenode). We do not make anyone pass an 'entrance exam', though we do like for
        people to supply a patch of some sort just to prove that you are serious.

        Support
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are some things you can help us with if you choose. When a person makes a donation, that donation is cataloged and made
        available to whichever developer is in the most need of it at the time. We do have a public list of donators (or at least will,
        whenever we get some donations).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>hardware donations.</strong> You can donate routers or other hardware to our developers, who may be in need of them for
          testing purposes. We are currently running our poor routers into the ground, so we encourage these type of donations. Devices
          needed:
          <ul>
            <li>Any router with a USB port.
            </li>
            <li>Any router you want us to work on support for.
            </li>
            <li>Anything you have left lying around.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>spread the word.</strong> Tell people you think might be interested about our project. Not even all OpenWrt users have
          heard of our project yet. You might consider mentioning X-Wrt on the OpenWrt forums and in #openwrt on freenode.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To prevent troubles with where money should go, we don't accept project-wide monetary donations. However, some developers do accept
        direct donations to them. We suggest you check the Berlios roster of developers of this project and develop to whichever people you
        choose. Also, if you want to see a particular feature developed, perhaps donating to a developer will encourage him or her to
        pursue that feature more quickly than he or she would have otherwise done.
