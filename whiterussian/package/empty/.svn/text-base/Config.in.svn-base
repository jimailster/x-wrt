	  empty is an utility that provides an interface to execute and/or interact 
	  with processes under pseudo-terminal sessions (PTYs). This tool is 
	  definitely useful in programming of shell scripts designed to communicate 
	  with interactive programs like telnet, ssh, ftp, etc. In some cases, empty 
	  can be the simplest replacement for TCL/expect or other similar 
	  programming tools.
