	  File tests each argument in an attempt to classify it. There
	  are three sets of tests, performed in this order: filesystem
	  tests, magic number tests, and language tests. The first test
	  that succeeds causes the file type to be printed.
	  
	  Starting with version 4, the file command is not much more than
	  a wrapper around the "magic" library.
