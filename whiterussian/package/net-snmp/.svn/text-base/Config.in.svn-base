	  Open source SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) implementation (libraries).
	  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used 
	  protocol for monitoring the health and welfare of network 
	  equipment (eg. routers), computer equipment and even devices 
	  like UPSs. Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to implement 
	  SNMP v1, SNMP v2c and SNMP v3 using both IPv4 and IPv6.
	  
	  This package contains shared libraries, needed by other programs.
