	  SoCat (for SOcket CAT) establishes two bidirectional byte streams and
	  transfers data between them.
	  Data channels may be files, pipes, devices (terminal or modem, etc.), or
	  sockets (Unix, IPv4, IPv6, raw, UDP, TCP, SSL). It provides forking,
	  logging and tracing, different modes for interprocess communication and
