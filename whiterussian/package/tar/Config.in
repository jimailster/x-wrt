	  The GNU tar program saves many files together in one archive and can
	  restore individual files (or all of the files) from that archive. Tar
	  can also be used to add supplemental files to an archive and to update
	  or list files in the archive. Tar includes multivolume support,
	  automatic archive compression/decompression, the ability to perform
	  remote archives, and the ability to perform incremental and full
	  backups.
