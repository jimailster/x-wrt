	 uShare is a UPnP (TM) A/V & DLNA Media Server. It implements the server 
	 component that provides UPnP media devices with information on available 
	 multimedia files. uShare uses the built-in http server of libupnp to stream 
	 the files to clients.
	 GeeXboX uShare is able to provide access to both images, videos, music or 
	 playlists files (see below for a complete file format support list). It 
	 does not act as an UPnP Media Adaptor and thus, can't transcode streams 
	 to fit the client requirements.
	 uShare is written in C for the GeeXboX project. It is designed to provide 
	 access to multimedia contents to GeeXboX but can of course be used by any 
	 other UPnP client device. It should compile and run on any modern POSIX 
	 compatible system such as Linux.
